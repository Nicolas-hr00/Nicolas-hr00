I am a student at the University of North Texas, and I am eager to learn new experiences and increase my knowledge. I am excited to meet more engineering fellows, learn from them, and show my skills on the professional field. I live in Denton-Texas at the moment, but I am willing to relocate. I am excited to learn about new places, and explore my opportunities. I like giving my best on everything I do, I can't guarantee to know everything , but what I can promise is to work as hard as I can to find the answers. I describe myself as a really hard worker person that doesn't get anything for granted. I will work on something until I get it.
