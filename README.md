![I am a Computer Science student](http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2015-08-19-mining-github-for-new-hires/github.png)

  I am a student at the University of North Texas, 
and I am eager to learn new experiences and increase my knowledge. 
I am excited to meet more engineering fellows, learn from them,
 and show my skills on the professional field.  I like giving my best on everything I do. I can't guarantee to know everything , but what I can promise is to work as hard as I can to find the answers. 

Skills: C++, C, REACT / JS  / CSS

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Digitalizing the patients records from a beaty center  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React
